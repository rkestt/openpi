# Changelog

## [Unreleased]

## [0.2.8] - 2026-08-12

v0.2.8 carries forward the v0.2.7 security and reliability work after that tag's Windows release job failed before publication.

### Added

- **Boundary regression coverage** — added a real Electron/Playwright smoke test plus production-adapter and IPC regressions for workspace, session, PTY, Git, file, and sidecar paths.
- **Validated sidecar protocol** — sidecar commands, responses, and Pi session events now reject malformed or mismatched messages before reaching the app UI.

### Changed

- **Desktop security hardening** — privileged IPC accepts only the trusted renderer, pins privileged operations to main-owned workspaces, rejects symlink and traversal escapes, and formats files without shell interpolation.
- **Session lifecycle reliability** — session replacements are serialized, stale responses are discarded, and failed replacements restore the prior session.
- **UI and startup cleanup** — improved keyboard and assistive-technology semantics, split usage modules, and lazy-loaded the Homescreen.

### Fixed

- **Windows release validation** — security and session-index regressions now use Windows-legal hostile filenames and platform-native absolute paths, allowing the cross-platform release matrix to exercise the same assertions on Windows, macOS, and Linux.

### Beta caveats

- macOS notarization and Windows code signing remain unconfigured. Coverage reporting and live provider authentication smoke tests remain pending.

## [0.2.7] - 2026-08-12

### Added

- **Boundary regression coverage** — added a real Electron/Playwright smoke test for renderer hydration, context isolation, sandboxing, and Node access, plus production-adapter and IPC regressions for workspace, session, PTY, Git, and sidecar paths.
- **Validated sidecar protocol** — sidecar commands, responses, and Pi session events now have runtime schemas that reject malformed or mismatched messages before they reach the app UI.

### Changed

- **Desktop security hardening** — privileged IPC now accepts only the trusted renderer, pins Git, PTY, search, file, and session operations to main-owned workspaces, rejects symlink/traversal escapes, and formats files without shell interpolation.
- **Session lifecycle reliability** — session replacements are serialized across active requests, active state is suspended during reload/fork, stale responses are discarded, and failed replacements restore the prior session.
- **UI and performance cleanup** — improved dialog, navigation, session, tab, chart, and diff semantics for keyboard and assistive technology use; split usage modules and lazy-loaded the Homescreen to reduce the initial renderer payload.
- **Documentation synchronization** — updated the README, STATUS, and ROADMAP for the supervised Pi 0.84.1 sidecar, shipped trust controls, v0.2.7 beta status, and the real Electron smoke command.

### Beta caveats

- **Beta distribution and coverage** — macOS notarization and Windows code signing remain unconfigured, and coverage reporting is unavailable until `@vitest/coverage-v8` is installed. Live provider OAuth, device-code, and manual-code flows remain unverified with real credentials.

## [0.2.6] - 2026-08-12

### Added

- **Pi extension compatibility gate** — normal typechecking now compiles OpenPi's shipped task guard and desktop bridge against the installed Pi SDK.

### Changed

- **Pi SDK 0.84.1** — upgraded the coding agent, model runtime, TUI, and TypeBox dependencies together while preserving OpenPi's existing JSONL v3 session integration.
- **Atomic Pi updates** — in-app Pi updates now install matching `pi-coding-agent` and `pi-ai` versions in one package-manager operation.
- **Homebrew cask generation** — release automation now emits architecture-aware casks in the syntax expected by current Homebrew. (`29137ff`)

### Fixed

- **Session replacement safety** — active work is aborted before extension shutdown and disposal during reload, replacement, and stop; cleanup still completes when cancellation fails.
- **Provider credential synchronization** — credentials saved by Pi are reported as a partial success when synchronization fails, preventing unnecessary repeat sign-in attempts.
- **Pi 0.84 extension contracts** — the task guard reads the workspace from extension context, and workspace trust follows Pi's current result contract.
- **Production dependency advisories** — updated vulnerable `brace-expansion`, `js-yaml`, and DOMPurify paths; npm and pnpm production audits now report no findings.

### Beta caveats

- Real provider OAuth, device-code, and manual-code flows were not executed with live credentials; automated coverage validates OpenPi's authentication bridge and error classification.

## [0.2.5] - 2026-07-27

### Added

- **Intel macOS builds** — tagged releases now build native Apple silicon and Intel installers, normal CI verifies both runner architectures, and the Homebrew cask selects the correct installer. (`09f4039`)
- **Pi 0.82 provider sign-in** — provider setup supports OpenRouter, Kimi Code, xAI, Anthropic, OpenAI Codex, and GitHub Copilot account-login flows alongside API keys. (`079b086`)
- **Provider authentication smoke guide** — added a live-account release checklist with credential-free evidence rules for browser, device-code, manual-code, cancellation, logout, and restart behavior. (`d40edf2`)

### Changed

- **Pi SDK 0.82.1** — migrated provider and model state to Pi's shared `ModelRuntime`, preserving extension-registered providers across credential refreshes. (`079b086`)
- **pi-task 0.3.7 compatibility** — task history, terminal states, and sub-session navigation now follow pi-task's current artifact contracts while retaining legacy session-path fallback. (`2dd93f6`)

### Fixed

- **Provider login lifecycle** — prompt cancellation, duplicate prompt replacement, optional manual-code input, logout acknowledgement, and provider refresh now remain synchronized across the sidecar, Electron main, and renderer. (`d40edf2`)
- **Provider event boundary** — malformed login events are rejected before renderer delivery, and only valid HTTP(S) authentication URLs may open externally. (`d40edf2`)
- **Markdown sanitization and updater dependencies** — updated DOMPurify and electron-updater and added regressions for executable markup and unsafe attributes. (`d40edf2`)
- **Git diff diagnostics** — no-workspace warnings now include the requested path instead of printing a literal placeholder. ([#6](https://github.com/heyhuynhgiabuu/openpi/pull/6))
- **Release artifact validation** — tagged builds now reject package-version mismatches, missing installers, wrong architecture names, and unmatched release uploads, including electron-builder's `x86_64` Linux naming convention.
- **macOS update metadata** — release builds include architecture-specific ZIP updates and publish one combined manifest that selects the correct Apple silicon or Intel download.
- **Release credential scope** — the Homebrew tap token is available only to the tap detection, update, and verification steps.

### Beta caveats

- Real provider account flows were not executed for this release; automated coverage validates OpenPi's authentication bridge, not external OAuth or device-code services.
- `npm audit --omit=dev` retains one high-severity `brace-expansion@5.0.7` finding inside Pi 0.82.1's published shrinkwrap; pnpm's production audit has no findings.

## [0.2.4] - 2026-06-30

- ### Added

- **Homescreen delete button**: per-session trash icon in the session list. Confirms via in-app modal before moving the file to the OS trash. Keyboard shortcut: Delete or Backspace on a focused session row.
- **Homescreen session deletion IPC**: new DELETE_SESSION channel with archive-then-trash semantics for active .jsonl files and direct trash for already-archived sessions. Path-traversal guard, OS-trash recovery.
- **ConfirmDialog component**: small in-app alertdialog with backdrop blur, centered flex layout, danger button styled via --danger token. Reused for destructive actions across the app.

### Changed

- **Line comment format is stable**: always emits startLine/endLine, no more line="N" shortcut. LLM only has to handle one shape.
- **File tree no longer intercepts Cmd/Ctrl+C**: that keybinding was overriding browser text-selection copy on the panel. Right-click context menu Copy still works.
- **Tool-name shimmer rewritten**: the opacity-pulse heartbeat look is gone. Now a soft left-to-right text-shimmer sweep that matches the dot-grid pacing.

### Fixed

- **Homescreen text shimmer was invisible**: TopBar was reading session.isStreaming instead of conversationStreaming(), so the dot grid only rendered for the active local turn. Tool rows also had an inline style attribute that overrode the CSS class animation; removed.
- **Conversation pane was stripping <file_comment> tags**: DOMPurify in MarkdownContent was dropping the custom tags, so the LLM still got the line number via Pi SDK but the human could not see it in the user message bubble. Added the tags + attrs to the allow-list.
- **Workbench context showed virtual URLs as 'Viewing file'**: the filter checked visibleFileAbs (which is cwd + relPath) instead of the unmodified visibleFile, so openpi-diff://review always passed the local-path check. Filter now uses the unmodified input.
- **Empty <selected_code> in review comments**: the file content IPC was returning null for review file paths. The review view already has the full new/old content loaded; added it as a fallback in the fileContent accessor. Also wrapped handleLineSelected in .then() after ensureFileContent to fix the race where the draft was set before the file content was loaded.
- **Review FileCard no longer calls handleLineSelected before the file content is loaded**: was a race between the async IPC and the synchronous draft set. Now the call is chained via .then() in all three entry points (line select, line number click, hover comment select).


### Fixed

- **Task guard was letting through model-hallucinated `task_id`s from old sessions.** The model (grok-composer-2.5-fast) recycles a `task_id` it saw earlier in the conversation — e.g. `mqzhz574-b765` after that task was already cancelled. The old guard only stripped UUIDs and format-invalid ids; well-formed but already-terminal ids passed through, and pi-task tried to "resume" the old task. The new guard reads `.pi/task-session-history.json` and strips any well-formed `task_id` whose id is in the history with status `done` / `cancelled` / `timeout` / `failed` (the "model is recycling a hallucinated id" case). Only an id that is `running` (i.e. a legitimate resume) or not in the history is allowed through. Added 7 new tests (`tests/openpiTaskGuard.test.ts`: 15 total) pinning the contract for the cancellation case, the legitimate-resume case, and the no-history fail-open case.

- **Task rows were non-clickable for fresh task calls**: the model correctly omits `task_id` on fresh `task` calls (per the `task-tool` skill), so `TaskToolRow` was always reading an empty id from the tool args and disabling the trigger. Now `TaskToolRow` consults a layered resolver as the authoritative source for the pi-task short id, with the structured `details.task_id` as a fallback. The resolver checks:
  1. `TaskTracker.tasks[]` keyed by `card.toolCallId` (populated from the result's `details.task_id` after the call ends).
  2. `card.details.task_id` (the structured result field) — defensive backup for when pi-task does not emit `task_id` in the `tool_execution_end` event.
  3. `.pi/task-session-history.json` — pi-task writes this at task start with `{id, agentType, description, startedAt}`. We match by `agentType` + `description` + closest `startedAt` (within a 5-minute window). This works for both running (history is written on start) and completed tasks. New IPC `openpi:read-task-session-history` and `findTaskIdForToolCall` helper.
  Wired `resolveTaskIdForCard(card)` through the prop chain (`ConversationWorkspace` → `ConversationPane` → `Messages` → `ToolCardView` → `TaskToolRow`).

### Added

- **Sub-session navigation from `task` tool rows**: clicking a `task` tool row in the parent session now navigates to the sub-session that pi-task created, replacing the inline expand-the-widget pattern with OpenCode's first-class session tree metaphor.
  - `electron/services/piTaskArtifacts.ts` exports `resolveSubSessionPath(artifactsDir, taskId)` — returns the first `.jsonl` under `<artifactsDir>/sessions/<taskId>/`, or `null`.
  - New IPC `openpi:resolve-sub-session-path` (handler in `electron/session/ipc.ts`, preload binding `window.openpi.session.resolveSubSessionPath`).
  - `useOpenPiSession` gains `openSubSession(taskId)` and `popToParent()`, plus a `parentStack` signal and an `isSubSession` derived flag. Stack is cleared when the user opens a different session via the sidebar.
  - New `src/lib/subSessionNavigation.ts` with `isSubSessionPath` for renderer-side path detection.
  - `ConversationWorkspace` renders a breadcrumb with "Back to <parent name>" when the active session is a sub-session; the button is disabled (with a tooltip) when the parent stack is empty.
  - `TaskToolRow` is now a navigation affordance: no expand body, a 5×5 animated dot grid for running tasks, a status pill (`running` / `completed` / `failed`), a compact result preview line, and a `→` chevron that translates on hover. Falls back to a non-interactive status line when the task has no resolvable sub-session.
- `tests/piTaskSubSessionPath.test.ts` (8 cases): regex / path-traversal defense / missing dir / empty dir / multi-file disambiguation.
- `tests/isSubSessionPath.test.ts` (4 cases): path-marker detection.
- `tests/findTaskIdForToolCall.test.ts` (14 cases): readTaskSessionHistory happy / missing / malformed / non-string-id; findTaskIdForToolCall by agentType / by description / by both / closest time / outside time window / sparse entries.

- Bundled `task-tool` skill (`.pi/skills/task-tool/SKILL.md`) teaching the model the correct `task` tool rules, to prevent `Unknown task_id` errors caused by passing UUIDs or `task_id` on fresh tasks.
- `.pi/APPEND_SYSTEM.md` with strict, unmissable `task` tool rules appended to every Pi session's system prompt (researched from pi-task v0.2.0 source).
- `tests/piTaskContract.test.ts` — contract tests locking OpenPi's alignment with pi-task v0.2.0 behavior (id format, error string, fresh vs resume, background default).

### Added (previous)

- Pi-task workbench: watches `.pi/artifacts/TASKS.md` from `@heyhuynhgiabuu/pi-task` and shows running tasks in the tray; live `task` tool progress in the session UI.

### Fixed (this revision)

- **OpenPi task-tool guard** (`.pi/extensions/openpi-task-guard.ts`): a Pi extension that hooks the `tool_call` event and **strips invalid `task_id` / `conversation_id`** before the `task` tool runs. Fixes the systematic model hallucination of UUIDs as `task_id` on fresh calls (e.g. `565c63f9-6aa2-4d40-a59b-18cccb0ab1a5`, `e2086af5-058e-47be-a2f5-1e4f7145e07f`, etc.). Contract tests in `tests/openpiTaskGuard.test.ts`.

### Changed

- Delegation requires `pi install npm:@heyhuynhgiabuu/pi-task` for the `task` tool. OpenPi no longer registers built-in `Agent` / `get_subagent_result` / `steer_subagent` customTools on the sidecar.
- Phase 7 beta evidence is `npm test` / Vitest, not `docs/TEST_MATRIX.md`.

### Fixed

- Emit `session_shutdown` before `session.reload()` so pi-task stops background polling that holds a captured `ExtensionAPI` — fixes stale extension ctx errors after resource reload.

### Removed

- Built-in subagent host (`electron/subagent/`).
- Ask UI (`ask_user_question` modal/widget) and goal/harness v2 overlay (`syncBridge`, harness plan CSS, harness roadmap docs).

## [0.2.3] - 2026-06-19

- Usage dashboard with activity heatmap, model leaderboard, and provider market share.
- Daily stacked model chart with mouse tracking and hover day preview.
- Provider share chart with interactive dimming and shared active state.
- Chart-matching color swatches in model and provider cards.
- Stable rank-based color assignment from OpenCode palette.
- Renamed "Top models" tab to "Models", "By provider" to "Market share".
- Simplified KPI cards: removed streak, peak day, duplicate per-session rows.
- Removed weekly/cumulative heatmap modes; heatmap is daily-only with hover drawer.
- 90-day range now computes real per-session metrics (not fallback).
- Fixed model swatch color index offset between featured and rest cards.
- Fixed `Missing named parameter` error in `readModelUsageBetween`.
- Fixed activity drawer clipping by using viewport-relative positioning.

## [0.2.2] - 2026-06-20

- Unified slash-command registry modeled on opencode's `command.tsx` pattern. `/compact`, `/name`, `/session`, `/reload`, `/copy`, `/new`, `/resume`, `/model`, `/scoped-models`, `/thinking`, `/settings`, `/login`, `/logout` are now handled by OpenPi itself instead of being hidden or sent to the model as plain chat. TUI-only builtins that cannot run in a desktop environment are no longer shown in the picker.
- Default Trust Policy setting (`ask` / `always` / `never`) added to the Pi settings pane, backed by `SettingsManager.getDefaultProjectTrust() / setDefaultProjectTrust()`. Writes to `~/.pi/agent/settings.json`.
- OpenPi workspace trust and Pi project trust are now wired through the bridge extension. The bridge registers a `pi.on('project_trust', ...)` handler that defers to the OpenPi workspace-trust gate (mirrored to `~/.pi/agent/.openpi-workspace-trust.json`). `ctx.isProjectTrusted()` now reflects the OpenPi UI state for all extensions, and falling back to `defaultProjectTrust` is honored when the file is missing.
- Package install/remove/update on the sidecar now runs with `--ignore-scripts` (Pi 0.75.4 supply-chain hardening).
- Bump bundled Pi from 0.79.6 to 0.79.7. Brings Pi 0.79.7's automatic theme mode, edit diff helpers, Vercel AI Gateway attribution, global `httpProxy`, Warp terminal image detection, and the in-place regression fixes from 0.79.5–0.79.7.
- The "Install" button on the Pi update section now reinstalls the bundled `@earendil-works/pi-coding-agent@<latest>` in OpenPi's own `node_modules/` via the package manager OpenPi was installed with, then prompts to restart OpenPi. The previous `pi update --self` path failed for OpenPi users with *"This installation is not managed by a global npm install."* because Pi is bundled in OpenPi's own `node_modules/`, not installed as a global `pi` CLI.
- Fix a SolidJS reactivity bug in the Customize modal's Pi Settings Pane: `FieldControl` captured the initial `props.value` into plain consts that never updated, so every field except the most-recently-set one rendered blank. The boolean toggle's onClick was also sending the stale initial value instead of the current state. (PR #4)
- Move the "Default Trust Policy" select to the Pi Settings Pane (where it loads and saves through the same `~/.pi/agent/settings.json` path as every other Pi setting) and remove the "Hide Customizations Panel" toggle that gated access to the very modal that hosts the toggle.
- `/name` without an argument now pre-fills the composer with `/name ` instead of showing a system alert dialog, matching Pi TUI's slash-command UX.
- `/resume` opens the homescreen overlay (the natural place to browse and resume sessions) rather than the command palette or a broken direct-open.

## [0.2.1] - 2026-06-17

- Surface Pi extension slash commands in the composer picker, including commands registered by extensions such as observational memory, pi-hermes-memory, and pi-pretty.
- Execute slash commands through Pi native prompt path so extension commands run as commands instead of being sent to the model as normal prompts.
- Bind OpenPi sidecar extension UI context and render `ctx.ui.notify()` output in the conversation as extension response cards.
- Preserve extension-registered model providers when refreshing model configuration.
- Bump `@earendil-works/pi-ai` and `@earendil-works/pi-coding-agent` to `~0.79.6`.
- Refresh the demo screenshot and refine conversation/picker surfaces, including transparent wrapping code blocks.

## [0.2.0] - 2026-06-16

### Added

- **Homescreen workbench layout** — replaced the old sidebar-first workspace with a homescreen, persistent right panel, wider welcome surface, and cleaner topbar session chrome. (f60dcc0, 751a9bb, a484529)
- **Git history in the preview surface** — added a Changes-panel graph button that opens Git history as a center preview tab with normal tab activation/close behavior. (ab92bbf)
- **Git changes workbench** — added a right-panel Git file tree, per-change-type coloring, diff preview flow, full-height changes body, persistent commit area, and Stage All / Unstage All bulk action behavior. (8de6dab, ab92bbf)
- **Artifact TODO surfacing** — renders subagent artifact `TODO.md` files in the file widget, hides completed todo files, and keeps one active running todo file visible. (3a8bf41, 027fc28, d9d3acf)
- **Tool-call name shimmer** — added a subtle text-only shimmer for visible tool call names while an agent run is active, with a slower 2.4s production pace and no visible config panel. (0f0121d, ba71265, 9d9f121, 627cb20)
- **File preview find controls** — added Cmd/Ctrl+F find bar support with wrap controls, plus a preview-toolbar search icon near the Vim toggle. (5bc9478, 21f3002)
- **Conversation context and tool polish** — added context usage popover stats, model/duration message metadata, and cleaner tool row rendering. (bd06f4c, bb715f7, d088561)
- **New provider display names** — Ant Ling, NVIDIA NIM, and Together AI are now visible by name in the model picker. New SDK models appear automatically through `ModelRegistry`. (d93aefd)
- **Headless Codex device-code login** — wired the required `onDeviceCode` OAuth callback through the typed provider login event channel. (d93aefd)

### Changed

- **Pi coding agent SDK** — bumped `@earendil-works/pi-coding-agent` from `^0.74.0` to `~0.79.3`, including project-trust hardening, public `extensionRunner`, public `session.dispose()`, newer Anthropic/OpenAI models, MiniMax-M3, and additional providers. (d93aefd, 902675d)
- **Node minimum** — pinned `engines.node` to `>=22.19.0 <23` to match Pi 0.75.0's floor. CI workflows use Node 22.19.0. (d93aefd)
- **Subagent/tooling surface** — replaced stale Anthropic task-tool references with the OpenPi subagent/file-tracker path and removed the deleted goal/harness extension surface. (2dff5d6, a91eb32, 265fa3c, 7b0076d, cbd98c3, 8666613)
- **File tree styling** — moved to grayscale-at-rest file icons, color on hover, git status badges, cleaner indentation, and refined context-menu/keybinding behavior. (e937605, d976576, f3ab8e7, c63c885, 2090d51, 64f6011, fc326f8, 24059b0, 5f42503)
- **Workbench chrome** — refined right-panel tabs, file tabs, preview toolbar/find bar borders, model toggles, homescreen icon, and main preview/diff backgrounds. (879377e, d599706, 01c753e, a484529)

### Fixed

- Emit `session_shutdown` before `session.reload()` so pi-task (and other extensions) stop background timers that use a captured `ExtensionAPI` — fixes stale extension ctx errors after `/reload` or resource reload.


- **File preview saves** — saving from CodeMirror now refreshes file-tree and Git-status observers so OpenPi surfaces update after edits. (21f3002)
- **Markdown task lists** — TODO-style checklists (`- [ ]` / `- [x]`) now render as checkboxes in OpenPi markdown surfaces, including generated `TODO.md` files. (bf2624f)
- **Tool shimmer lifecycle** — tool names now shimmer for the full active agent run instead of flickering per individual tool card, and stop when the agent ends. (6c0d9ac, 9d9f121)
- **Release workflow setup** — corrected `setup-node` indentation and the release job's Node 22.19.0 pin so CI and release jobs use the intended runtime. (88a0d36)
- **Private-API poke in sidecar teardown** — sidecar shutdown now uses Pi 0.79.3's public `session.extensionRunner` getter and a valid shutdown reason. (d93aefd)
- **File tree actions** — replaced prompt-based rename UI with Kobalte context menu actions and fixed preview filename sync after rename. (e937605, e462ac19)
- **Panel resizing and first-try UI feedback** — fixed file panel drag-resize sign and addressed the first review batch of workbench UI feedback. (bfaa14c, e6120f9)
- **Conversation thinking display** — removed thinking-block chrome, wired the hide-thinking setting, and kept the thinking icon animation visible. (2002c5d, cee0bd2)

## [0.1.19] - 2026-05-27

### Fixed

- **Terminal pane startup** — toggling the terminal panel (Cmd+J) now auto-creates a terminal tab instead of showing an empty panel. Fixed PTY race condition where early shell output was dropped and missing error feedback on spawn failure. Prevented repeated PTY spawns caused by SolidJS remounting on shell integration cwd updates. (8d5cbd5)
- **Workspace thread count** — clicking a workspace in the sidebar now refreshes the thread index before listing, so other workspaces no longer show stale or missing thread counts. Scoped stale-session cleanup to the refreshed workspace to prevent deleting other workspaces' indexed sessions. (65cc36b)
- **Customize General tab** — fixed sound effect selections not persisting by closing the picker on document mousedown only for clicks outside the picker. Reset scroll position when switching Customize tabs so content no longer starts scrolled to the previous tab's offset. Added missing CSS for the Installation subsection (subheading, action button group, update status). Removed non-null assertions from update status display. (ed118b4)
- **Code block copy** — copying code blocks no longer includes rendered line numbers in the clipboard; line-number elements are stripped before writing. (94e6f0c)

## [0.1.18] - 2026-05-22

### Added

- **Sticky plan dock** — persistent bottom widget for `update_plan` with auto-hide on completion, expand/collapse toggle, active step spinner animation. Pi TUI version uses `belowEditor` placement with animated spinner frames. (dd45fa1, 8a0b1bb)
- **CodeMirror search performance** — file preview search now passes the editor document (`Text`) directly instead of creating `Text.of(text.split('\n'))` on every keystroke, eliminating the 1–2s delay on large files like `index.css`. (859f3a8)

### Changed

- **refactor: massive module splitting across the codebase** — every file over 500 LOC was split into focused sub-modules:
  - `App.tsx` reduced from 1,332 to 518 LOC by extracting 5 hooks (`useAppFileManager`, `useAppKeybindings`, `useAppArchive`, `useAppPrefs`, `useWorkbenchLayout`) and 4 workbench components (`ConversationWorkspace`, `GitSidePanel`, `AppOverlays`, `WorkbenchSidebar`).
  - `ConnectProviderModal.tsx` reduced from 1,108 to 270 LOC (6 extracted modules).
  - `GeneralPane.tsx` reduced from 861 to 129 LOC (5 extracted modules).
  - `GitPanel.tsx` reduced from 857 to 294 LOC (8 extracted modules + hook).
  - `SettingsPane.tsx` reduced from 760 to 181 LOC (extracted `settingsSections.ts`).
  - `FileSearchModal.tsx` reduced from 534 to 311 LOC (extracted `FileHitsList`, `TextResultsList`).
  - `Messages.tsx` reduced from 555 to 298 LOC (extracted `SystemMessage`, `UsageRow`, `MessageActions`, `UserMessage`).
  - `ToolCardView.tsx` reduced from 883 to 60 LOC (10 extracted tool row components).
  - `PackagesPane.tsx` reduced from 587 to 310 LOC (3 extracted modules).
  - Provider modal: extracted `BuiltInProviderRow`, `CustomProviderRow`, `CustomProviderFormView`, `ProviderListView`, `SubscriptionProviderRow`, `providerActions`, `providerLoginEvents`.
  - `Composer.tsx`: 18 helper modules extracted.
  - `useOpenPiSession.ts`: 5 hooks extracted (`useExtensionTrackers`, `useAgentRunMetrics`, `useSessionIndex`, `useSessionHistory`, `useRemoteSessionSync`).

### Fixed

- **Plan dock completion** — plan dock now auto-hides in both OpenPi and Pi TUI when all steps are completed. (8a0b1bb)
- **Plan dock visual polish** — active border changed from blue to white, header icon removed per user preference. (cee9aee)

## [0.1.17] - 2026-05-19

### Added

- **Goal and plan feedback loop** — added durable goal/plan sync for OpenPi, a structured `clear_goal` tool, clearer `update_plan` output for Pi TUI, and explicit guidance separating ephemeral plans from durable `pi-tasks`. (173c823, caa39ec)
- **Terminal polish** — added shell integration for zsh/bash cwd markers, true-color env, WebGL rendering, Ghostty-like styling, Nerd Font fallback, cwd-aware terminal tab labels, rename flow, and exit indicators. (00e86e0)
- **File editor upgrades** — migrated preview editing to CodeMirror 6 with language support for TS/JS, Rust, Python, HTML/CSS, JSON, and Markdown; added working word wrap, Vim mode, search highlighting/autoscroll, and a persisted theme selector for GitHub, Tokyo Night, Nord, Atom One, Aura, Xcode, and Copilot-like themes. (820d2c0, 8d6b4ac, ac37a66)
- **Workbench file controls** — added file/folder delete from the file tree with main-owned trash confirmation, Git/file tree refresh, and automatic closing of deleted previews. (c8f7e3c)
- **Harness and IPC coverage** — expanded IPC, PTY, session index, and harness lint coverage. (e5c420a)

### Changed

- **Workbench surfaces** — polished file preview search behavior, file tree scrolling, plan tool cards, Git/file surfaces, composer metadata, and release update metadata. (c8f7e3c, 3dda132)
- **Stories navigation** — removed the bottom-bar Stories entry point while keeping story docs available in the repository. (caa39ec)
- **Roadmap and architecture docs** — documented Phase 7 Agent Workbench Quality and Terax architecture lessons. (fdf1258, b7462eb)

### Fixed

- **OpenPi bridge detection** — fixed `workerPid` getter and `OPENPI_BRIDGE_APP` sync bridge detection. (452e200)
- **Composer TPS display** — summed per-message durations and moved TPS display into the Composer. (ae258b2)
- **Release automation** — pinned `action-gh-release` with explicit token handling and fail-on-unmatched-assets behavior. (21b4186)

## [0.1.16] - 2026-05-18

### Added

- **Session Map panel** — interactive tree view of the Pi session tree with branch navigation, fork points, compaction summaries, label badges, and click-to-scroll. Redesigned as a Session Map with compact inspector density: inline summary header, hidden zero-metric cards, single-line normal entries, important-only metadata, smaller markers/rails, lighter solo active branch styling. Auto-refreshes when agent finishes a turn. (8fafe7c, 6269ecb)
- **Agent-aware Git workflow** — agent-changed files IPC emits file paths on agent end. Clickable agent banner in GitPanel with animated Kobalte tooltip showing changed file paths (status-colored, monospace font) with 300ms open delay and TooltipArrow. Filtered review view for agent-only files. AI commit message generation uses agent turn context when available. (8baeeef)
- **SVG commit graph** — colored lane dots (8-cycle colors) with vertical, diagonal, and horizontal connection lines replacing raw ASCII `<pre>` output. 14px column widths, 28px row height. (b18c6c1)
- **Ref badge labels** — branch, remote, tag, and HEAD badges parsed from `%D` refs format with distinct color-coded styling. (b18c6c1)
- **Commit diff viewer integration** — clicking a changed file in commit details opens the commit-version diff in the side-by-side DiffViewer via new `GET_COMMIT_DIFF` IPC. (b18c6c1)
- **Open on GitHub** — button in commit details when remote origin is detected as github.com (supports HTTPS and SSH remotes). (b18c6c1)
- **Branch picker enhancements** — inline create-branch input with duplicate checking. Stash apply, pop, and drop action buttons with color-coded hover states. (b18c6c1)
- **Inline AskWidget tray** — compose area inlined in the main panel instead of opening as a separate modal. (5bd0734)

### Changed

- **Session Map density** — compact inspector mode is now the default layout, reducing visual noise for long single-branch sessions. (6269ecb)
- **Code block line numbers** — always shown by default; removed the line-number toggle button. (2fddc7e)
- **User messages rendered as markdown** — user messages now render through the markdown pipeline for consistent formatting. (3a8cf74)

### Fixed

- **Sidecar session lifecycle** — `session_shutdown` emitted before `session.dispose()` so extensions can clean up timers and ctx references, preventing stale-ctx crashes on session replacement or reload. (69fc393)
- **Line number regex** — full `<span class="line">` tag consumed to prevent stray `>` characters in rendered code blocks. (00ba1aa)

## [0.1.15] - 2026-05-17

### Added

- **Conversation polish** — live token counter during streaming (`generating ~X tok`), code block line numbers (toggle via `Ln` button), streaming cursor that works after any element type, subtle fade-in for new message groups, responsive image rendering.
- **File editor improvements** — format-on-save toggle (Biome formats after each save, content updates to formatted version), word wrap toggle (pre-wrap/break-word), `Cmd+Shift+F` opens find-with-replace (VS Code convention).
- **Terminal tabs polish** — double-click tab label to rename inline, green/gray dot indicator for running/exited process, exited tabs dimmed.
- **Extensions UI** — each extension card now has an enable/disable toggle switch (role="switch", aria-checked), preferences persisted to `~/.pi/agent/openpi-extension-preferences.json`, reload button in the extensions toolbar.
- **Onboarding flow** — first-run detection via `GET_FIRST_RUN` IPC (checks for existing sessions), enhanced welcome screen with 3-step getting-started guide, links to Pi repo and OpenPi source.
- **Goal status indicator** — persistent banner in the composer header when `/goal` is active, showing the objective text and running/idle step badge, dismissible.
- **Story browser** — sidebar panel listing all `docs/stories/` entries with status badges (planned/in_progress/implemented/changed/retired), search via `listDirectory` IPC.
- **Harness lint pre-commit hook** — `scripts/harness-lint.sh` checks for missing harness docs, test matrix gaps, and legacy migration state before commits.
- **Pi subagent and task tool support** — tool card rendering for `Agent`, `TaskCreate`, `TaskExecute` with rich arg previews; tool labels for subagent, task, harness, and legacy tools.

### Changed

- **Harness v2 tools** — `/goal` controller replaced `/specs` as the public command, powered by 7 v2 harness tools (`harness_status`, `harness_intake`, `harness_init`, `harness_lint`, `story_create`, `decision_record`, `test_matrix_update`). Legacy `spec_*` adapters removed from the extension; tool card rendering in the UI preserved for old transcripts.
- **Extension code quality** — split monolithic `index.ts` (984 lines) into `index.ts` (entry + tool registrations), `harness-tools.ts` (execute implementations), and `templates.ts` (doc template strings). Deleted `specs-core.ts` (422 lines of legacy adapter helpers).
- **Product docs** — full `docs/` directory with `HARNESS.md`, `FEATURE_INTAKE.md`, `TEST_MATRIX.md`, 3 ADRs, 6 story packets, and templates.
- **Harness lint warning** — the pre-commit check now also verifies test matrix evidence columns and optional harness directories.

### Fixed

- **Welcome screen alignment** — removed `max-width: 460px` from `.welcome-onboarding` so the "Getting started" section aligns flush-left with the main header.
- **OpenPi repo URL** — corrected from `github.com/huynhgiabuu/openpi` to `github.com/heyhuynhgiabuu/openpi`.
- **Cmd+Shift+F conflict** — assigned to open find-with-replace (matching VS Code/Zed) instead of format; format remains button-only in the editor toolbar.
- **!important in onboarding CSS** — replaced with specific selector `.welcome-onboarding .welcome-onboarding-intro`.

## [0.1.14] - 2026-05-16

### Added

- **Delivery mode keybindings** — `Alt+↑` activates interrupt (steer) mode while the agent is running; `Alt+↓` activates follow-up (queue) mode. Both toggle: pressing the same key again resets back to normal prompt mode. Both actions are registered in the keybinding system as `steerMode` / `followupMode` and are remappable from the Keybindings pane.
- **Delivery mode reset button** — a `RotateCcw` icon button appears in the composer toolbar whenever a delivery mode is active, colour-tinted to match the active mode (amber = interrupt, blue = follow-up). Clicking it resets the delivery mode back to normal.
- **Rich compaction card** — compaction events now surface the full file context that Pi's TUI shows. After auto-compact, a collapsible "files" badge appears inline with the `Compacted from N tokens` pill. Expanding it shows `Modified` and `Read` file lists (pill-tagged with amber/neutral colours) extracted from the SDK `CompactionResult.details`. The `reason` field (`manual`/`threshold`/`overflow`) is also reflected in the card text (e.g. "Manually compacted from N tokens").

### Fixed

- **Add context file picker invisible** — `overflow: hidden` on `.composer-toolbar` and `.composer-toolbar-left` was clipping the absolutely-positioned `.ctx-picker` before it could extend above the toolbar. Changed both to `overflow: visible`; per-label text truncation (`.composer-tool-label`) is unaffected since it has its own `max-width`/`overflow: hidden`/`text-overflow: ellipsis`.

### Performance

- **Eliminated thinking-block flicker** — `buildSegments()` was returning new object references on every `thinking_delta` event, causing `<For>` to destroy and remount `ThinkingBlock` and `MarkdownContent` on every streaming token. The resulting `html()` reset to `''` produced a visible phase-1 plain-flash. Fixed with `createStore + reconcile({ key: 'id', merge: true })` in `AssistantMessageGroup`: segments matched by stable id are now updated in-place on the same store proxy, so `<For>` sees the same reference and keeps components alive.
- **Eliminated `AssistantMessageGroup` remounts** — `groupMessages()` was returning a brand-new `RenderItem[]` on every delta, causing `<For>` in `ConversationPane` to destroy and recreate every `AssistantMessageGroup`. Fixed with the same `createStore + reconcile` pattern at the conversation level: groups are matched by their stable id and updated in-place.
- **Lazy `applySessionEvent` copies** — removed the unconditional `const next = [...messages]` upfront spread. Each case now creates a local copy only when it actually modifies the array. Early-exit paths and the `default` case return the original reference unchanged, so downstream memos (`groupMessages`, `aggregateUsage`) skip recomputation for events that touch nothing.
- **`allText` deferred to copy-click** — the full-text string join across all assistant messages was running on every streaming delta but was only needed when the user clicks the copy button. Changed `MessageActions` to accept a `getText` thunk called only at click time.
- **`keybindingEntries` memoised** — `buildKeybindingEntries()` was rebuilt on every `keydown` event via a plain lambda. Changed to `createMemo` so the result map is rebuilt only when keybinding preferences actually change.
- **Removed no-op `contextPercentValue` memo** — `createMemo(() => contextPercent())` wrapping a plain signal adds an unnecessary reactive layer. Replaced with direct `contextPercent()` access.
- **Two-level Shiki/markdown render cache** — added a bounded LRU code-block cache (400 entries, shared across all `MarkdownContent` and `FilePreviewPane` instances) in `shiki.ts`, and a bounded LRU full-markdown HTML cache (150 entries) in `MarkdownContent`. When VList scrolls a completed message out of view and back, the final highlighted HTML is restored instantly from cache — no Phase-1 plain flash, no re-parse. The code-block cache also eliminates redundant Shiki grammar runs for repeated snippets across a long session. Both caches are keyed by theme so dark↔light switches naturally invalidate and re-render.
- **Idle animation GPU budget** — added `agent-streaming` class to `app-shell` during agent runs and used it to pause `.pulse` (typing dots) and `.bottom-bar-git-pulse` (git sync indicator) animations when the agent is idle. Infinite CSS animations promote elements to GPU compositor layers even when nothing visually changes; pausing them when not needed reduces GPU texture memory and compositor work.

 - 2026-05-16

OpenPi v0.1.13 focuses on the desktop workbench experience: persistent file preview tabs, a bottom utility bar, safer archived-session cleanup, smoother composer history recall, and more reliable markdown/code rendering.

### Added

- **Center file preview pane** — workspace files now open in the main workbench surface with tabs, editable line-numbered text, markdown/code preview, image preview, save support, find/replace, minimap, and file-line comment chips for agent context.
- **Bottom utility bar** — added a compact bottom bar for thread/workspace navigation, Git/file/terminal panel toggles, app update status, and live Git sync feedback.
- **Workspace pane** — added a workspace-focused left drawer showing recent project roots, active workspace state, session counts, and quick “new thread in workspace” actions.
- **Movable Git panel** — the source-control panel can be dragged to the left or right of the conversation pane, with its side persisted across launches.
- **Branch/stash picker overlay** — Git refs now open from the top bar as a floating picker for local branches, remote branches, and stashes.
- **Composer prompt history** — pressing ↑ in the composer recalls previous user prompts, with ↓ returning toward the saved draft.
- **Output history buffer** — startup, sidecar, update, and crash output emitted before the Output pane opens is now replayed when the pane mounts.

### Changed

- **Git layout** — split the Git file tree into its own file panel and streamlined the source-control panel around changes, history, commit composition, and sync actions.
- **Markdown rendering** — message markdown now uses a cached Shiki-backed parser, code-block copy buttons, table wrappers, language alias handling, and theme-aware syntax colors.
- **Shiki loading** — syntax highlighting uses bundled dark/light themes and the JavaScript regex engine to avoid CSP/WebAssembly startup failures.
- **File preview search controls** — replaced the show/hide replace, replace-next, and replace-all controls with clearer Lucide icons.
- **Sidebar filter menu** — anchored the filter/sort menu to the sidebar toolbar so it no longer clips off-screen.

### Fixed

- **Archived session deletion safety** — deleting archived sessions now requires confirmation, only accepts `.jsonl.archived` files under Pi’s sessions directory, validates symlinks with real paths, and moves files to the system Trash instead of permanently unlinking them.
- **Workspace image preview boundary** — `localfile://` image serving is constrained to regular files inside the active workspace, preventing renderer-originated previews from reading arbitrary local paths.
- **Markdown injection hardening** — code-block language labels and fallback code HTML are escaped, and rendered markdown is sanitized before insertion into the renderer.
- **Release lint gate** — reformatted changed files so `npm run lint` is clean before the version bump.

## [0.1.12] - 2026-05-15

OpenPi v0.1.12 fixes fork-from-message crashes, the GitHub Copilot device-code login flow, and a silent extension-loading failure that caused global Pi extensions (e.g. `copilot-provider.ts`) to be bypassed even when shown as Active. Also fixes slash prompt/skill expansion and refreshes icon assets.

### Fixed

- **Fork from message** — forking a conversation from a streamed assistant message no longer throws `Entry u-<timestamp> not found`. Streamed messages carry synthetic `u-`/`a-`-prefixed IDs; the sidecar now resolves these back to real 8-char hex entry IDs by matching timestamps against the Pi session tree before calling `createBranchedSession`.
- **GitHub Copilot device-code login** — the OAuth `auth` event (carrying the device verification URL and user code) was silently dropped when it fired while the modal was in the `prompting` phase (the enterprise-domain prompt precedes the device-code step). The `auth` handler now also accepts `phase === 'prompting'`, and the user code is extracted from the `instructions` string and shown with a copy button instead of as raw text.
- **Global extensions not loading when workspace is untrusted** — `additionalExtensionPaths` was passed `agentDir/extensions/` (the extensions folder itself). The Pi SDK treats that argument as a package root and looks for an `extensions/extensions/` subdirectory inside it; finding none, it falls back to adding the directory path as a file, which `jiti.import` then fails to load silently. The extension never registers its OAuth provider, so Pi falls back to built-in Copilot auth. Fixed by passing `agentDir` instead so the SDK correctly scans `agentDir/extensions/` for `.ts` files.
- **Slash prompt expansion** — selecting `/review` now sends exactly one leading slash, so Pi expands prompt templates from `.pi/prompts`, `~/.pi/agent/prompts`, settings, and packages instead of sending `//review` or plain text (`1baa166`).
- **Slash prompt context handling** — attached files, line comments, and loaded context are now combined after prompt-template expansion, so `/review` still applies the Markdown template when context is attached (`1baa166`).
- **Slash skill expansion** — `/skill:name` autocomplete and typed skill commands now use Pi's sidecar `DefaultResourceLoader` and expand before attached context is prepended, matching Pi SDK behavior (`1baa166`).

### Added

- **Task widget** — when a Pi session uses `pi-tasks`, a collapsible widget above the composer tracks live task state (pending → in-progress → completed) with subject, active form, and ✓/●/○ icons; clears automatically on new session.
- **Ask User Question modal** — when `pi-askuserquestion` poses structured questions, a floating modal above the composer renders radio/checkbox option rows, a free-text row, and N-of-M progress dots. Answers are forwarded via `steer()` while the agent is running or `followUp()` when idle, so responses reach Pi even when the extension self-disables in headless mode.
- **Subagent status widget** — when `pi-subagents` spawns background or foreground agents, a collapsible widget shows each agent's type, description, elapsed time, and status (running/queued/completed/failed) with a pulsing indicator for active agents.
- **Extension Active/Inactive status chips** — each extension card in the Customizations panel now shows an Active or Inactive chip. User-scope global extensions (`~/.pi/agent/extensions/`) are always Active; project-local extensions show Inactive with an inline trust banner when the workspace is not yet trusted.

### Changed

- **App icon refresh** — replaced packaged icon assets across macOS, Windows, Linux, and multi-size PNG outputs for the 0.1.12 beta.

## [0.1.11] - 2026-05-15

OpenPi v0.1.11 ships Phase 6: Trust, Policy, and Release Hardening — putting explicit security boundaries around Pi extensions, packages, file mutations, secrets, and release artifacts.

### Added

- **Workspace trust model** — new workspaces are untrusted by default; project-local extensions and packages are disabled until the user explicitly trusts the workspace (`a80e60c`). Trust state persisted in Electron-main–owned SQLite with an additive `trusted_at` column migration.
- **Resource provenance inventory** — every Extension, Skill, Prompt, Theme, and Package now shows path, scope (global/project/package), origin, risk level (`high`/`medium`/`low`), and last-modified timestamp in the Customizations panel (`f5d09cb`).
- **Extension/package enablement gates** — enabling project-local extensions displays a confirmation panel listing each extension path before trust is granted (`f328e4e`). Installing a Pi package shows a two-step confirmation with source, scope, and full-system-permissions warning before the install proceeds.
- **Protected path policy** — Electron main blocks or confirms writes to sensitive locations including `~/.ssh`, `~/.gnupg`, Pi AuthStorage, shell profiles, `.gitconfig`, `.git/objects`, and paths outside the trusted workspace (`f5d09cb`). Git stage and commit paths are validated before reaching `simple-git`.
- **High-risk mutation confirmations** — destructive shell commands (`rm -rf`, `git reset --hard`, `git clean`, force-push, rebase-abort, disk commands, `chmod 777`, `chown -R`) routed through Pi sidecar are intercepted and require Electron-main approval before forwarding (`c8a16b1`). Same gate applied to Git discard/revert, package install/remove, and workspace trust promotion.
- **Secret storage and redaction** — `electron/secretRedact.ts` redacts GitHub tokens, Anthropic/OpenAI API keys, AWS access keys, Bearer auth headers, and generic env-var assignments from logs, IPC output, and diagnostics bundles (`f5d09cb`).
- **Diagnostics export bundle** — General → Beta support diagnostics copies a redacted JSON bundle to clipboard with app/runtime/OS metadata, sidecar+session state, workspace trust, resource inventory, Git status, and SQLite file stats. Provider credentials owned by Pi AuthStorage are never read (`f328e4e`).
- **MCP capability clarification** — extension security note explicitly states that MCP server integration requires a Pi extension or package; Pi does not natively embed MCP (`297f279`).
- **SQLite durability hardening** — `PRAGMA synchronous=NORMAL`, `foreign_keys=ON`, `busy_timeout=5000` applied on open; `wal_checkpoint(TRUNCATE)` on close; migration loop now covers all columns (`last_model`, `file_mtime`, `trusted_at`) so missing-column ALTER TABLE errors no longer crash cold starts (`f5d09cb`).
- **Release CI hardening** — per-platform artifact size verification (≥1MB), SHA-256 checksum merging into `checksums.txt`, macOS notarization conditional on `CSC_LINK` secret, Windows signing conditional on `WIN_CSC_LINK`, Homebrew tap post-update verification (`f5d09cb`).

### Changed

- Settings pane adds Model & Thinking, Compaction, Retry, Message Delivery, UI, Terminal, Shell, Sessions, and Resources sections driven by a declarative field schema — replaces the previous minimal form.
- `installPackage` / `removePackage` IPC handlers gate on Electron-main `confirmHighRiskMutation` dialog in addition to the renderer-side two-step confirmation.

### Fixed

- Cold-start SQLite crash when `last_model` or `file_mtime` columns were absent from an older DB.
- Trust state not invalidating cached Pi resource loader — cache key now includes `workspaceTrusted` so session restart after trust grant picks up extensions correctly.

## [0.1.10] - 2026-05-14

OpenPi v0.1.10 consolidates the CI hermetic fixes, packaged-app sidecar launch fix, Homebrew release automation, and Electron security upgrade.

### Added

- **Homebrew tap automation** — release publishing now updates `heyhuynhgiabuu/homebrew-openpi` automatically from the packaged arm64 DMG when `BREW_TAP_TOKEN` is configured (`1d7cab8`)

### Fixed

- **Packaged Pi sidecar launch crash** — packaged builds now force `utilityProcess.fork()` so the sidecar can load from Electron ASAR archives instead of crashing under standalone system `node` (`7ff4263`)
- **Electron security audit** — upgraded Electron from 37.x to 41.6.0 to resolve the high-severity advisories reported by `npm audit`, including AppleScript injection (`GHSA-5rqw-r77c-jp79`) and service-worker IPC spoofing (`GHSA-xj5x-m3f3-5x3h`), while staying on the latest native-addon-compatible stable line; `npm audit` now reports 0 vulnerabilities (`1a49f0b`)
- **Deprecated rebuild dependency** — removed unused `electron-rebuild@3.2.9` and replaced it with `@electron/rebuild@4.0.4`, eliminating transitive CVEs from outdated `tar`, `cacache`, and `node-gyp` versions (`1a49f0b`)
- **Native addon rebuild hook** — `npm ci` now runs `electron-rebuild -f -w better-sqlite3` so the development app starts with Electron's Node ABI instead of crashing on a host-Node build (`b7e4351`)
- **CI: npm lockfile sync** — regenerated `package-lock.json` with npm 10 peer/optional resolution so `npm ci` installs the Electron 41 and electron-builder 26 dependency graph cleanly on GitHub Actions (`d7dc5d5`)
- **Release workflow Homebrew guard** — moved the optional `BREW_TAP_TOKEN` check through job env so GitHub Actions no longer rejects the workflow before jobs are created (`ad13f54`)
- **CI: bare remote default branch** — `git init --bare` on ubuntu-latest defaults to `master`; tests now pass `-b main` explicitly so the bare remote's HEAD matches the branch we push (`19d670a`)
- **CI: hermetic git identity** — pin `GIT_AUTHOR_*` / `GIT_COMMITTER_*` env vars in the git integration test file so runners with no global git identity don't fail commits (`6558204`)


## [0.1.9] - 2026-05-14

OpenPi v0.1.9 ships Phase 5 Git workflow, merge conflict resolution UI, and two critical bug fixes for slash commands and skill injection.

### Added

- **Git: enriched status** — upstream tracking, detached HEAD detection, conflict chip, in-progress operation (merge/rebase/cherry-pick), stash count in panel header (`12354bb`)
- **Git: remote sync menu** — fetch, pull, pull-rebase, push with confirmation gates; icon-only sync button (`7885eee`)
- **Git: branch and stash picker** — search-first; dirty-worktree guard blocks unsafe checkout (`4858694`)
- **Git: history graph tab** — `git log --graph` ASCII lane rendering, commit search, selected commit details pane with per-file `+N/-N` stats (`70c3134`, `86312a4`, `ce4dc18`)
- **Git: side-by-side diff viewer** — replaced custom unified renderer with `@pierre/diffs` `FileDiff`; `containerWrapper` mount path so shadow DOM split layout applies correctly (`e4d69f0`)
- **Git: agent-aware commit workflow** — `AGENT_CHANGED_FILES` event fires after `agent_end` when uncommitted changes exist; dismissible banner in Changes tab; ✨ sparkle button generates conventional-commit messages via local heuristics (`e4d69f0`)
- **Git: Zed-style commit composer** — dark composer box, segmented Commit Staged / options / push control; amend and signoff toggles wired through `git commit --amend/--signoff` in Electron main (`e4d69f0`)
- **Git: file save in viewer** — `WRITE_FILE` IPC (path-traversal validated, main-owned); Save button + `⌘S`; dirty/saved/error status badges in file viewer toolbar (`e4d69f0`)
- **Git: merge conflict resolution** — `ConflictResolverModal` using `@pierre/diffs` `UnresolvedFile`; conflicted files grouped under a Conflicts section (red heading) above Staged/Changes; accept current/incoming/both buttons; saves resolved content via `WRITE_FILE` and refreshes git status (`e4d69f0`)
- **Customizations: Pi package management** — install and remove Pi packages from the Packages pane (`27eadd1`)

### Fixed

- **Slash command / prompt template activation** — selecting from the `/` picker stripped the leading slash so `session.prompt()` received `review` instead of `/review`; the Pi SDK's `expandPromptTemplates` guard (`text.startsWith("/")`) skipped expansion entirely; restored `/${cmd.name}` prefix (`5b49015`)
- **Skill injection format** — chip-based skill context sent raw frontmatter and omitted the `location` attribute and `References are relative to …` note; now matches Pi SDK `_expandSkillCommand()` output exactly so relative script paths in skills resolve correctly (`b21a8a3`)
- **Compaction token wording** — copy now correctly shows `tokensBefore` context size rather than implying freed tokens (`1faf5a1`)
- **Native module ABI** — `better-sqlite3` and other native modules rebuilt against Electron's Node.js ABI via `electron-rebuild`; fixes packaged app crash on startup (`b7e4351`)
- **Pi SDK process isolation** — Pi SDK now runs in an isolated Node child process via the sidecar to avoid Electron renderer conflicts (`c390c9b`)

### Changed

- Sync and search buttons in Git panel header are icon-only for a cleaner toolbar (`dc622bc`)


## [0.1.8] - 2026-05-14

OpenPi v0.1.8 adds Homebrew cask distribution and makes the update chip point users toward Homebrew upgrades.

### Added

- **Homebrew cask distribution** — OpenPi can now be installed and upgraded from the `heyhuynhgiabuu/openpi` Homebrew tap with `brew install --cask openpi` and `brew upgrade --cask openpi`.

### Changed

- **Update chip behavior** — The in-app update chip now copies the Homebrew upgrade command instead of opening the GitHub release page, reducing manual download/install noise for beta users.

## [0.1.7] - 2026-05-14

OpenPi v0.1.7 fixes packaged-app fff native loading from ASAR/unpacked paths.

### Fixed

- **Packaged fff native loading** — Packaged macOS builds now import `@ff-labs/fff-node` from `app.asar.unpacked` so its `libfff_c.dylib` path resolves to a real file instead of the virtual `app.asar` archive path. `FileFinder.create()` is also guarded so native loader failures always fall back to filesystem search instead of surfacing as empty picker results.
- **fff cwd contract** — fff IPC now requires an explicit absolute workspace cwd from the renderer and no longer silently falls back to mutable Electron main session state.

## [0.1.6] - 2026-05-13

OpenPi v0.1.6 fixes fff-backed file search across workspace switches and hardens beta release publishing.

### Fixed

- **fff workspace targeting** — File search, content search, command palette file search, plus-button context picker, and inline `@` file mentions now pass the renderer's active workspace cwd through IPC instead of relying on Electron main's mutable session state. This prevents searches from running against a stale or wrong cwd while the visible UI is on another workspace.
- **fff empty-query and grep fallback** — Empty file searches now fall back to filesystem listing when native fff returns no items, and content grep has a bounded filesystem fallback when native fff is unavailable or returns no matches.

### Changed

- **Native fff packaging** — The `@ff-labs`, `ffi-rs`, and `@yuuang` native packages are explicitly unpacked from ASAR so their platform dylibs/binaries can be loaded reliably in packaged Electron builds.
- **Release artifact actions** — Beta release artifact upload/download steps use current GitHub action major versions to avoid Node 20 runtime deprecation warnings on future release runs.
- **Latest release visibility** — Beta release publishing uses normal GitHub Releases instead of prereleases so OpenPi's existing `/releases/latest` update check can see newly published versions.

## [0.1.5] - 2026-05-13

OpenPi v0.1.5 fixes the packaged-app file mention fallback path and hardens release automation so GitHub Releases always publish current changelog content.

### Fixed

- **File mention fallback after native fff import failure** — The fff host no longer imports `@ff-labs/fff-node` at module load time. If the native package fails to import in a packaged app, OpenPi now still loads the host module and uses filesystem fallback search instead of returning no file mention results.
- **GitHub release notes source** — The beta release workflow now extracts release bodies from the matching `CHANGELOG.md` version section, preventing stale `RELEASE_NOTES.md` content from being published to new GitHub Releases.
- **CI action runtime warnings** — CI and beta release workflows use current GitHub action major versions to avoid Node 20 deprecation warnings on GitHub-hosted runners.

### Changed

- **Release helper safeguards** — `scripts/release.mjs` now requires explicit release notes and refuses to generate placeholder-only changelog entries.

## [0.1.4] - 2026-05-13

OpenPi v0.1.4 hardens the file attachment picker, fixes workspace startup scoping, and documents stricter release-note requirements.

### Fixed

- **File mention picker reliability** — `@` file attachments now wait briefly for fff's cold-start scan and fall back to a bounded filesystem search if the native fff package is unavailable, quarantined, or temporarily returns no matches. This keeps queries like `@AG` finding `AGENTS.md` instead of showing a permanent "No files match" state.
- **Workspace startup scope** — startup restore and the workspace rail now use only workspaces explicitly opened in OpenPi. Historical Pi session directories discovered during indexing no longer pollute the rail or cause OpenPi to auto-restore the wrong workspace.
- **Ignore generated artifacts correctly** — `.gitignore` now uses standalone comments instead of inline comments after patterns, so generated `out/` and `release/` directories are actually ignored by Git.

### Changed

- **Release discipline** — Project rules now require every release to inspect commits since the previous tag and replace automation-generated placeholder changelog entries with concrete user-facing notes before tagging.

## [0.1.3] - 2026-05-13

OpenPi v0.1.3 improves update visibility, CI reliability, file attachments, Git/workspace synchronization, and beta documentation.

### Added

- **App self-update check** — OpenPi now checks GitHub Releases on cold start and exposes a sidebar update chip when a newer version is available. Unsigned beta builds open the release page in the browser instead of attempting an in-app auto-install.
- **What's New modal** — Added a sidebar changelog button that reads bundled `CHANGELOG.md` from app resources and renders release notes inside OpenPi.

### Fixed

- **Git panel workspace switching** — Git status polling and file-tree watching now restart on every `session_ready` event, so the persistent Git panel follows the active workspace instead of showing stale data from a previous workspace.
- **Initial `@` file picker failure** — Removed stale fff initialization tracking that could permanently return `[]` after a failed native `FileFinder.create()` attempt.
- **CI test environment** — Added a deterministic in-memory `localStorage` stub for Vitest and removed the undeclared optional `@testing-library/jest-dom` setup import, restoring clean `npm ci && npm test` behavior on GitHub Actions.
- **CI workflow compatibility** — Updated CI to use valid GitHub Actions versions, run verification with verbose test output, and compile on macOS, Linux, and Windows after verification passes.
- **Release version correction** — Deleted the accidental `v0.1.4` tag and restored the intended `v0.1.3` release line.

### Changed

- **Public wording** — Removed misleading "native" wording from docs and product text; OpenPi is described accurately as an Electron desktop workbench.
- **Release packaging** — Bundled `CHANGELOG.md` via `electron-builder` `extraResources` so packaged apps can show release notes offline.

## [0.1.2] - 2026-05-13

OpenPi v0.1.2 enables Pi package extensions in sessions and makes package-loading failures non-fatal.

### Fixed

- **Pi packages can load session extensions** — Removed the `noExtensions: true` resource-loader setting so user-configured Pi packages such as `@heyhuynhgiabuu/pi-diff`, `@heyhuynhgiabuu/pi-pretty`, and `@heyhuynhgiabuu/pi-search` can register their tools and extensions in OpenPi sessions.
- **Non-fatal package reload failures** — Wrapped Pi resource-loader reload paths so one failing package no longer crashes session startup.


## [0.1.1] - 2026-05-13

# OpenPi v0.1.1

Patch release with two bug fixes since v0.1.0.

## Fixes

- **npm ENOENT on Finder/Dock launch** — OpenPi now enriches `PATH` from the user's login shell before starting the Pi SDK, so packages configured with Pi (npm-backed Skills, Prompts, or Extensions) resolve correctly whether the app is launched from a terminal or directly from macOS Finder/Dock. Previously launching from Finder/Dock would log `Failed to run npm root -g: spawnSync npm ENOENT`.
- **Customizations modal sidebar** — Removed the broken logo image from the brand block at the bottom of the Customizations nav rail; only the app name and version label are shown.

## What is OpenPi?

OpenPi is a desktop workbench for the [Pi coding agent](https://github.com/earendil-works/pi). It wraps Pi's session tree, streaming conversation, extensions, skills, and customizations in an Electron + SolidJS UI.

OpenPi depends on `@earendil-works/pi-coding-agent` and intentionally does not reimplement Pi's session tree, compaction, queue semantics, tool execution, extensions, or provider behavior.

## Beta caveats

- macOS notarization and Windows code signing are not configured yet; expect OS trust warnings on downloaded installers.
- Permission gates, workspace trust hardening, and keychain-backed secrets are roadmap items before broad stable distribution.
- This beta is for early testers comfortable running local developer tools.


## [0.1.0] - 2026-05-13

Initial public beta for early testers.

- Added Electron + SolidJS desktop workbench for Pi sessions, workspace navigation, model selection, conversation streaming, and tool cards.
- Added OpenCode-style command palette (`Shift+Cmd+P`) for commands, files, and sessions.
- Added Customizations modal for Pi Extensions, Skills, Prompts, Themes, Packages, models, notifications, keybindings, updates, and app info.
- Added persistent Git/source-control panel with file tree, file search, diff viewer, and file viewer.
- Added bottom terminal/output panel backed by Electron main and `node-pty`.
- Added OpenPi app branding, runtime version metadata, icon packaging, CI, and tag-triggered beta builds.

## [0.2.2] - 2026-06-18

- Unified slash-command registry modeled on opencode's `command.tsx` pattern. `/compact`, `/name`, `/session`, `/reload`, `/copy`, `/new`, `/resume`, `/model`, `/scoped-models`, `/thinking`, `/settings`, `/login`, `/logout` are now handled by OpenPi itself instead of being hidden or sent to the model as plain chat. TUI-only built-ins that cannot run in a desktop environment are no longer shown in the picker.
- Default Trust Policy setting (`ask` / `always` / `never`) added to the Pi settings pane, backed by `SettingsManager.getDefaultProjectTrust() / setDefaultProjectTrust()`. Writes to `~/.pi/agent/settings.json`.
- OpenPi workspace trust and Pi project trust are now wired through the bridge extension. The bridge registers a `pi.on('project_trust', ...)` handler that defers to the OpenPi workspace-trust gate (mirrored to `~/.pi/agent/.openpi-workspace-trust.json`). `ctx.isProjectTrusted()` now reflects the OpenPi UI state for all extensions, and falling back to `defaultProjectTrust` is honored when the file is missing.
- Package install/remove/update on the sidecar now runs with `--ignore-scripts` (Pi 0.75.4 supply-chain hardening).
- Bump bundled Pi from 0.79.6 to 0.79.7. Brings Pi 0.79.7's automatic theme mode, edit diff helpers, Vercel AI Gateway attribution, global `httpProxy`, Warp terminal image detection, and the in-place regression fixes from 0.79.5–0.79.7.
- The "Install" button on the Pi update section now reinstalls the bundled `@earendil-works/pi-coding-agent@<latest>` in OpenPi's own `node_modules/` via the package manager OpenPi was installed with, then prompts to restart OpenPi. The previous `pi update --self` path failed for OpenPi users with *"This installation is not managed by a global npm install."* because Pi is bundled in OpenPi's own `node_modules/`, not installed as a global `pi` CLI.
- Fix a SolidJS reactivity bug in the Customize modal's Pi Settings Pane: `FieldControl` captured the initial `props.value` into plain consts that never updated, so every field except the most-recently-set one rendered blank. The boolean toggle's onClick was also sending the stale initial value instead of the current state. (PR #4)
- Move the "Default Trust Policy" select to the Pi Settings Pane (where it loads and saves through the same `~/.pi/agent/settings.json` path as every other Pi setting) and remove the "Hide Customizations Panel" toggle that gated access to the very modal that hosts the toggle.
- `/name` without an argument now pre-fills the composer with `/name ` instead of showing a system alert dialog, matching Pi TUI's slash-command UX.
- `/resume` opens the homescreen overlay (the natural place to browse and resume sessions) rather than the command palette or a broken direct-open.
